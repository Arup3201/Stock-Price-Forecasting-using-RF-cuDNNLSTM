    "*What Is Intraday Return?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The intraday return is one of the two components of the total daily return generated by a stock. Intraday return measures the return generated by a stock during regular trading hours, based on its price change from the opening of a trading day to its close. Intraday return and overnight return together constitute the total daily return from a stock, which is based on the price change of a stock from the close of one trading day to the close of the next trading day. It is also called daytime return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intraday return is of particular importance for day traders, who use daytime gyrations in stocks and markets to make trading profits, and rarely leave positions open overnight. Day trading strategies are not as commonplace for regular investors as they were before the 2008-2009 recession.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "*How to Calculate Daily Returns?*\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a daily return, you subtract the starting price from the closing price. Once you have that, you simply multiply by the number of shares you own.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, let's say you own `100` shares of XYZ stock. The day opens at `$20` and closes at `$25`. This is a `$5` positive difference. Multiply the `$5` difference by the `100` shares you own, for a daily return of `$500`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some investors will prefer to work in percentages rather than dollar amounts. This is only slightly more complicated. You perform the same first step and arrive at a `$5` gain per share for the day. You then divide by the opening price of `$25`, leaving you with `0.2`. Multiply by `100` to arrive at your daily return of `20%`.\n",

    "\n",
    "This introduces multi-feature setting consisting not only of the returns with respect to the closing prices, but also with respect to the opening prices and intraday returns to predict each stock, at the beginning of each day, the probablity to outperform the market in terms of intraday returns.\n",
